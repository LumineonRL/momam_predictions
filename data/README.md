## Data

`channel_data` contains `csv` files of each streamer's yearly playtime for every game they streamed that year. This data was collected from https://sullygnome.com/
`momam7` contains two files:
  `MOMAM7 Schedule.xlsx` is not directly used anywhere in the analysis, but was used to construct `momam7_base_data.csv`.
  `momam7_base_data.csv` contains the historical records of every past MOMAM that's ever taken place. The `winner` column in this file is what we're aiming to predict.
